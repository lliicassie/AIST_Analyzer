# UnderGround_Analyzer

A C++ GUI Implementation of interdisciplinary dance analysis.

The name represents its initially designed for a hiphop dances academic research project. 

This tool is built to benefit users not familiar with code interface, including researchers in multiple fields and whoever is interested in automatic dance analysis. 


The calculation either uses Python script or C++. The calculation algorithms are written by me. 


This is a tool that automatically annotates dance movements in the dance video with its linguistic features.

The input should be dance videos or dance motion files in COCO format or SMPL format.

The file output will be hierarchical annotation files that represent how dancers interact with the physical environments.

The GUI interface will display meaningful and interesting visualizations during analysis.

 

**UPDATE**


progress 1/100

The preliminary framework of the project has been uploaded. It includes the interface between C++ and Python, the GUI module, and some Python calculation scripts.
