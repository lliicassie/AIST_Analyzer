# AIST_Analyzer

A C++ GUI Implementation of interdisciplinary dance analysis.

This tool is built to benifit users not familiar with code interface, including researchers in multiple fields and whoever in interested in automatic dance analysis. 


The calculation either uses Python script and C++. The calculation algorithms is written by me. 


This is a tool that automatically annotates dance movements in the dance video with its linguistic features.

The input should be dance videos or dance motion files in coco format or SMPL format.

The file output will be hierarchical annotation files that represent how dancers interact with the physical environments.

The GUI interface will display meaningful and interesting visualizations during analysis.

 

**UPDATE**


The preliminary framework of the project has been uploaded. Including the interface between C++ and Python, the GUI module, and a bit of python calculation scripts.
